# Violent Python (CYBV473)
**This is a lazy implementation and will be parsed to real projects with READMEs for their functions. Apologies!**

Solutions I have developed for various assignments in an Offensive/Defensive Python course at the Univeristy of Arizona Cyber Operations, Cyber Engineering program.
Each week will contain a set of required scripts and screenshots of their output.

For WK5, you can use the memdump.bin as a test file to run through for both script 1 and 2.
