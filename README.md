# Violent Python (CYBV473)

Solutions I have developed for various assignments in an Offensive/Defensive Python course at the Univeristy of Arizona Cyber Operations, Cyber Engineering program.
It is an 18 week course and will be updated as I complete more solutions.
Each week will contain a set of required scripts and screenshots of their output.

For WK5, you can use the memdump.bin as a test file to run through for both script 1 and 2.
